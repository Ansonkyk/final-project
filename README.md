In this final project, my goal is to make a stock simulator. One of the ideas is to generate should someone buy or sell a stock by some simple stock buy and sell model and using yahoo finance to fetch data. The idea is that someone can wake up in the morning and input some stock symbol they are interested in. Then, the website will return whether the stock is worth investing in or should sell right away. The website will also plot a graph of last year's stock performance and how much the investor can make if they use such a model in their investment.
* The model I use will be simple, and ideally, I would input quite a few of them. Most of them use some average to determine if the stock is growing or dropping, 
* then the user will input the money they are going to invest and the symbol of the stock after submitting. 
* the program will grab the stock data, run an analysis using existing stock data, see the best action on the stock, show it, and show how much investors can make last year using this method. 
* save all previous analysis stock and display the stock have the highest income last year using such method(hopefully keep using the method this year will also gain that much)
* something similar to hacker news; I can display some news related to that stock(done). And may even analyze them, on the right of each new will be a number suggesting how much it realted to stock performance, higher the closer.
* Allow user to mock buy and sell stock
* remain stretch goal is to allow the user to choose between different methods rather than the only one way.




## Please don't rapid test any button on the website, espacially the buy, sell and submit button, since I am using a free version of api, it will start getting errors, those button only only use every in total 5 times every minute.
